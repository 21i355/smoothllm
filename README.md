This is the official source code for "[SmoothLLM: Defending LLMs Against Jailbreaking Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03684)" by [Alex Robey](https://arobey1.github.io/), [Eric Wong](https://riceric22.github.io/), [Hamed Hassani](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hassani/), and [George J. Pappas](https://www.georgejpappas.org/).  To learn more about our work, see [our blog post](https://debugml.github.io/smooth-llm/).

## Installation

**Step 1:** Create an empty virtual environment.

```bash
conda create -n smooth-llm python=3.10
conda activate smooth-llm
```

**Step 2:** Install the source code for "[Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043)."

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks.git
cd llm-attacks
pip install -e .
```

**Step 3:** Download the weights for [Vicuna](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5) and/or [Llama2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf) from HuggingFace.  

**Step 4:** Change the paths to the model and tokenizer in `configs/vicuna.py` and/or `configs/llama2.py` depending on which set(s) of weights you downloaded in Step 3.  E.g., for vicuna, change the following paths in `configs/vicuna.py`:

```bash
config.model_paths = ["/path/to/vicuna-13b-v1.5"]
config.tokenizer_paths = ["/path/to/vicuna-13b-v1.5"]
```

## Experiments

We provide ten adversarial suffix generated by running GCG for Vicuna and Llama2 in the `data/` directory.  You can run SmoothLLM by running:

```bash
bash smooth_llm.sh <llm-name>
```

where`<llm-name>` is either `vicuna` or `llama`.  In `smooth_llm.sh`, you can also change SmoothLLM's hyperparameters: the number of copies, the perturbation percentage, and the perturbation function.  

```bash
perturbation_type='RandomSwapPerturbation'
perturbation_percentage=10
num_smoothing_copies=10
```

At present, we support three kinds of perturbations: swaps, patches, and insertions.  For more details, see Algorithm 2 in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03684).  To use these functions, you can replace the `perturbation_type` variable with `RandomSwapPerturbation`, `RandomPatchPerturbation`, or `RandomInsertPerturbation`.
